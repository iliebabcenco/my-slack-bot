# Ruby Telegram Bot

I did this project for learning purposes as a capstone project from Microverse after completing the Ruby curriculum.
Ut us a Telegram bot for playing the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Description

# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic-tac-toe Game is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

The following example game is won by the first player, X:

Game of Tic-tac-toe, won by X
Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.
